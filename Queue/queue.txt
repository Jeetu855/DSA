Queue using single ptr:
insertion O(1)
deletion O(n)

Using 2 ptrs:
when Queue is empty:front==rear==-1
front pointing before first element whereas rear pointing upon last element
insertion and deletion O(1)
queue empty:front==rear

if front pointing upon first element then empty condition is:
front>rear

full condition:
rear=size-1

Drawbacks of Queue using Array:
cannot reuse spaces of deleted elements
every location can only be used once
situation hwere Queue is empty as well full at same time

solution so we can reuse space:
1)resetting pointers
when queue becomes empty.bring front and rear to -1
but this method dosent guarantee reusing of space

2)circular queue
front and rear mov circularly
front and rear start from 0;
insertion and deletion O(1):best method
